=OneZero

==About

OneZero is a very simple application that shows how Haskell, Yesod and Server Events can work together.
It is based on Yesod's chat subsite example: http://www.yesodweb.com/blog/2012/01/wiki-chat-subsite .
Similar, slightly more complex project: http://github.com/nbartlomiej/tfoo .

Live at: http://onezero.herokuapp.com

Attention: Server Events are supported only by the following browsers: http://caniuse.com/eventsource .
